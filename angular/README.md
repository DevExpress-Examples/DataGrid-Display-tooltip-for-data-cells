Take a look at the following files of this example to see the required code: 

[app.component.html](src/app/app.component.html)

[app.component.ts](src/app/app.component.ts)

We also illustrate how to use the [events](https://js.devexpress.com/Documentation/ApiReference/Common/utils/events/) API to subscribe to mouseover / mouseout events without using jQuery.
